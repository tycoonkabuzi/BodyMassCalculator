              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
              Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
              experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
              diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
              content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
              strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes
              daily for five days a week.

    What your BMI result means A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a
    'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
    experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.
    Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
    ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
    activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week. Healthy
    eating Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better
    digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and mood. Regular exercise Exercise
    improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
    risk, fostering wellness and longevity. Adequate sleep Sleep enhances mental
    clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting overall
    restoration and rejuvenation. Limitations of BMI Although BMI is often a
    practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person.
    Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain
    cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use. Gender The development
    and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a
    child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI. Age In
    aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to
    underestimate body fat content. Muscle BMI may misclassify muscular
    individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from
    fat. Pregnancy Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
    baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise
    health risks for both mother and child. Race Certain health concerns may
    affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than
    others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or
    practice nurse.
